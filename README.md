# Python-Homework
HW 4.

This code is written to decifer kmers of any size "K".
It reads the nd2.fasta file.
In this file the DNA sequences are every third line.  The first line is a title and the second line is a space.
The code will only run for line numbers that are in increments of 3 starting at 1. (1, 4, 7, 10).
the pandas data frame allows you to count the amount of possible kmers and the total that are in a specific sequence.
I was not able to figure out code for calculating a liguistic complex.  I assume it involves adding all the oberseved and possible kmers for each k value and dividing them by themsleves.
